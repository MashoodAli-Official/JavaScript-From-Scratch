    <h1>Method Overriding in Javascript</h1>
    <p>In simple terms, method overriding in JavaScript happens when a child class creates a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, but gives it a new behavior or different functionality. This way, when you call the method on an object of the child class, the child class version is used instead of the parent class one.</p>
