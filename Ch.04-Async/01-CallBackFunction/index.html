    <h1>CallBack function in javascript</h1>
    
    <p>A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an 
        argument to another function. It is commonly used in asynchronous 
        programming to execute code at a later time, such as fetching data, 
        making API calls, waiting for events, or performing a task after 
        completing one.
    </p>
    <p>In this example code, we define a function called `myHero()` and
         also include a callback function called `heroName()` as an 
         argument to `myHero()`. The `myHero()` function sets a delay 
         of 4 seconds and then calls the `heroName()` callback function. 
         The `heroName()` function is executed after the delay.
