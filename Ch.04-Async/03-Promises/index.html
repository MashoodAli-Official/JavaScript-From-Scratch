    <h1>Promises in Javascript</h1>
    <p>Promises in javascript is a JavaScript object that represents the 
        eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and it's resulting value.
        They provide a way to handle asynchronous code in a more structured and readable manner.
    </p>
    <h4>OR</h4>
    <p>A Promise in JavaScript is like a placeholder for a result that isnâ€™t ready yet. 
        It helps handle actions that take time, like loading data from the internet, 
        without stopping everything else in the code.
    </p>

    <h4>A Promise having 3 States</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pending : Still not defined OR undefined</li>
        <li>Fulfilled : Finished Successfully</li>
        <li>Rejected: Failed to finish OR Error with reason.</li>
    </ol>
