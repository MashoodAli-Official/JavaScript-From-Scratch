    <h1>Scope in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>The scope of a variable is the region in which that variable is accessible.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Global Scope</b>: The variable is declared outside the function is called global scope.</li>
        <li><b>Local Scope</b>: The variable is declared inside the function is called local scope.</li>
        <li><b>Block Scope</b>: Before ES6 the only two type of scope were introduces, Global scope and 
            local scope. In ES6 the new variable keywords (let and const) were introduced to declare new 
            variables. Any variable declared with let or const inside {} block, it will not access 
            outside the block. </li>
    </ul>
