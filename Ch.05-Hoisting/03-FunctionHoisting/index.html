    <h1>Function Hoisting in javascript</h1>
    <p>Function hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism that allows you to call 
        a function before its declaration. This is because function declarations 
        are "hoisted" to the top of their scope, regardless of where they're 
        actually defined.
