// Immutability means that an object or data structure cannot be modified after it is created. Instead, when you want to make changes, you create a new object or data structure with the updated values.

let hero = { name: "Iron Man" };
hero.name = "Hulk"; // The original object is modified

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // The original array is modified
