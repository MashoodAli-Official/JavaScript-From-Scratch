    <h1>For loops in javascript</h1>
    <p>A for loop in JavaScript is a control flow statement 
        that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. 
        It's particularly useful when you want to run code a 
        specific number of times or iterate over elements 
        in an array.
    </p>
    <b>For example</b>
    <p>for (initialization; condition; update) </br> 
        {// code to be executed}
    </p>
