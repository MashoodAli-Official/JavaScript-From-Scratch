# Simple Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing code to make it more structured, modular, and reusable. In JavaScript, OOP allows us to create objects that represent real-world things or concepts. Each object has properties (data) and methods (functions) that define its characteristics and actions. This approach makes code easier to understand and manage, especially as projects get bigger.

## Topic we will learn in OOP
Commonly there are 5 different principles of OOP in Javascript.
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Classes and Objects: </b>
        The basics of creating templates (classes) and making individual items (objects) based on them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Encapsulation: </b>
        How to keep certain data and functions private to an object, so they can only be accessed or modified in controlled ways.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Abstraction: </b>
        Simplifying complex functionality by hiding unnecessary details, exposing only whatâ€™s essential.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Inheritance: </b>
        How one class can inherit properties and methods from another, allowing code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Polymorphism: </b>
        polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
    </li>
</ul>
We'll cover each OOP topic with a simple explanation and code example.
